Tom Waits Lyrics










"Please Call Me, Baby"







The evening fell just like a star

Left a trail behind

You spit as you slammed out the door

If this is love we're crazy

As we fight like cats and dogs

But I just know there's got to be more




[CHORUS]

So please call me, baby

Wherever you are

It's too cold to be out walking in the streets

We do crazy things when we're wounded

Everyone's a bit insane

I don't want you catching your death of cold

Out walking in the rain



And I admit that I ain't no angel

I admit that I ain't no saint

I'm selfish and I'm cruel but you're blind

If I exorcise my devils

Well my angels may leave too

When they leave they're so hard to find




[CHORUS]



And we're always at each other's throats

You know it drives me up the wall

But most of the time I'm just blowing off steam

And I wish to God you'd leave me

Baby I wish to God you'd stay

Life's so different than it is in your dreams




[CHORUS]
