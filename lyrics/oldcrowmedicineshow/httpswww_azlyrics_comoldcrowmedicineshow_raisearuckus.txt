Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Raise A Ruckus"







Well well well 




[Chorus:]

Come along little children come along 

While the moon is shining bright 

Now get on board going down the river float 

We gonna raise a ruckus tonight 



Well my old mistress promised me 

Raise a ruckus tonight 

That when she died she'd set me free 

Raise a ruckus tonight 

Well she lived so long that her head got bald 

Raise a ruckus tonight 

I finally had to kill her with a white oak maul 



Well well well 




[Chorus]



Well our old lady gets mad at me 

Raise a ruckus tonight 

When I won't drink at the India tea 

Raise a ruckus tonight 

Well now she is good and then she is bad 

Raise a ruckus tonight 

Boys she's evil like a devil when she gets mad 



Well 




[Chorus]
 



Well Raise a ruckus tonight 

Raise a ruckus tonight 

Now we gonna raise a ruckus tonight 

Raise a ruckus tonight 



Well well well 




[Chorus]



Well raise a ruckus, raise a ruckus 

Raise a ruckus tonight 

Get on board going down the river float 

We gonna raise a ruckus tonight
