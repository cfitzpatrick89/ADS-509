Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"James River Blues"







James River blues

I just heard the awful news

I could steer around the rocks

But they're bustin' down the docks



James River blues

That train came on through

And the work's gotten slow

Now wheres a boat man to go



I think I'll float on down

To Richmond town

They don't need us anymore

Haulin' freight from shore to shore

That big iron hauls much more

Than we ever could before



I've see good men going wrong

I've seen bad ones get it right

As that river rolls along

I'll be steppin' out tonight



On the cool flow

Floatin' down, down below

The bridge to the waters edge

From the ridge to the ledge

From the hills to the sea

I'll become a memory



James River blues

James River blues

James River blues
