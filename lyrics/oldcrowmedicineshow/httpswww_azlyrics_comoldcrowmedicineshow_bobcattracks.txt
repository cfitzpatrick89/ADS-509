Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Bobcat Tracks"







Bobcat tracks in the snow

Tell me, mister bobcat, where is it that you go?

Down among the town lights, in that valley below

Tell me, mister bobcat, where is it that you go?



There's a horse on my trail, beggin' a meal

Bitin' at my hands, they're so cold I can't feel

Tell me mister horse, what is your deal?

Yeah, what is your deal?



Feral dog on my right

Pissin' on a rosebush on this clear, frozen night

Tell me, mister dog, do you feel all right?

Do you feel all right?



(Yeah, do you feel all right?) Do you feel all right?



Bobcat tracks in the snow

Tell me, mister bobcat, where is it that you go?

Down among the town lights, in that valley below

Tell me, mister bobcat, where is it that you go?



(Where do you go?) Where is it that you go?

(Where do you go?) Yeah, where is it that you go?



(Where do you go?) Tell me, mister bobcat where is it that you go?
