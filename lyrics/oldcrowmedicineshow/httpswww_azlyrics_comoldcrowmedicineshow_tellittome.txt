Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Tell It To Me"







Well I'm ridin' down Fifth Street, I'm comin' down Main

I tried to bum a nickel for to buy cocaine

Cocaine's gonna kill my honey dead




[Chorus:]

Now won't you tell it to me

Tell it to me

Drink the corn liquor let the cocaine be

Cocaine's gonna kill my honey dead



I sniff cocaine before I die

I'd be sniffin' cocaine if it took my life

Cocaine's gonna kill my honey dead




[Chorus]



Now I sniff cocaine, I sniff it in the wind

The doc he says it'll kill me but he can't say when

Cocaine's gonna kill my honey dead




[Chorus]



All them rounders that think they're tough

But they feed their women on the beer and the snuff

Cocaine's gonna kill my honey dead




[Chorus]
