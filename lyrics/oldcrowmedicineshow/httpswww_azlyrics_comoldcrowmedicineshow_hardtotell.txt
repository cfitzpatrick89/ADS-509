Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Hard To Tell"







Now the way things look around this town 

Better find a pretty woman before the sun goes down 

If you need a place to lay your head 

Find a pretty little woman in a pretty big bed 



You make like a fool, you stumble around 

Better find you a woman before you buy another round 

In like a lamb and out like a lion 

One minute your laughin' the next you're cryin' 




[Chorus:]

Its hard to tell, hard to tell 

You gotta get a woman its hard to tell 

Can't be sure, can't be sure 

Is she gonna be your pretty little girl? 

Your pretty little girl 



Better cut your hair, comb that mop 

Shine them shoes, wear tails and top 

Trim that 'stache, don't be slow 

You gonna need it where you got to go 



Hit that trail ride that roan

and buck that limb when you get her back home 

Buckle up boys don't think twice

and love that woman with all your might 




[Chorus]
 



Now she don't call and she don't write 

You're home with your mother every Saturday night 

You see her on the town, she don't see you 

You oughta quit courtin' and take up booze 



You gotta make it look like a big for-tune, 

got Callico shorts and alligator shoes 

There ain't no woman gonna waste her time, 

waiting for a poor boy to drag her down 




[Chorus]
