Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"God's Got It"







Well..

If you want it, God's got it

He's got everything you need. 
[3x]

He got every, everything a poor man need



Walkin' around like a vagabond

Troubles are on your back

Lookin' for money, lookin' for friends

And you don't know who to ask



If you want it, God's got it

He's got everything you need. 
[2x]



I believe in the Lord above

(I believe in the righteous. I believe in love)

I believe in the fire burnin' in my soul

I believe that His light is gonna make me whole.



If you want it, God's got it

He's got everything you need. 
[2x]

Well, if you need it now

God's got it now

He's got everything you need. 

He got every, everything a poor man need.



God's got it. (He's got it)
