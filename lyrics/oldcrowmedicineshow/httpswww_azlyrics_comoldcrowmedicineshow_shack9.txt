Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Shack #9"








[Verse]

Oh, they grow it by the pound in johnson county 

Well, they grow it by the pound in johnson county 

Oh, they grow it by the pound 

And their breath will knock you down 

Yes, they grow it by the pound in johnson county 




[Chorus]

Take me back to my shack #9 

Take me back to my shack #9 

There a dog on my track 

And a corn/cord/quart in my shack 

Take me back to my shack #9 




[Verse]

All the men they'a chew tobacco in johnson county 

All the men they'a chew tobacco in johnson county 

Well it'll drip right down there chin 

And they'll lick it up again 

And they'll lick it up again in johnson county 




[Chorus]

Take me back to my shack #9 

Take me back to my shack #9 

There a dog on my track 

And a corn/cord/quart in my shack 

Take me back to my shack #9 




[Verse]

Well, the women will dip snuff in johnson county 

Oh, the women will dip snuff in johnson county 

Oh, the women will dip snuff 

But they'll never get enough 

All the women will dip snuff in johnson county 




[Chorus]

Take me back to my shack #9 

Take me back to my shack #9 

There a dog on my track 

And a cord/corn/quart in my shack 

Take me back to my shack #9
