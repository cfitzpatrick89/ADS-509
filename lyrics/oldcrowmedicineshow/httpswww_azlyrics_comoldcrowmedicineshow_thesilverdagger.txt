Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"The Silver Dagger"







Oh Katie dear go ask your mama 

If you can be a bride of mine 

If she says yes come back and tell me 

If she says no we'll run away 



Oh Willie dear there's no use in asking 

For she's in her room a taking rest 

And by her side lies a silver dagger 

To slay the one that I love best 



Oh Katie dear go ask your papa 

If you could be a bride of mine 

If he says yes come back and tell me 

If he says no we'll run away 



Oh Willie dear there's no use in asking 

For he's in his room a taking rest 

And by his side lies a silver dagger 

To slay the one that I love best 



Then he picked up that silver dagger 

And he stove it through her troubled heart 

Saying goodbye Katie goodbye darlin 

I'll die for the one that I love best 



Then she picked up that bloody dagger 

And she stove it through her lily white breast 

Saying goodbye mama goodbye papa 

I'll die for the one that I love best
