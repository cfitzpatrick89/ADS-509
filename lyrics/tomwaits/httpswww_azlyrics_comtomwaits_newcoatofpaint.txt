Tom Waits Lyrics










"New Coat Of Paint"







Let's put a new coat of paint on this lonesome old town

Set 'em up, we'll be knockin' em down.

You wear a dress, baby, and I'll wear a tie.

We'll laugh at that old bloodshot moon in that burgundy sky



All your scribbled lovedreams, are lost or thrown away,

Here amidst the shuffle of an overflowing day

Our love needs a transfusion so let's shoot it full of wine

Fishin' for a good time starts with throwin'in your line.
