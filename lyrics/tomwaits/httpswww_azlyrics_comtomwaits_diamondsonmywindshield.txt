Tom Waits Lyrics










"Diamonds On My Windshield"







Well these diamonds on my windshield

And these tears from heaven

Well I'm pulling into town on the Interstate

I got a steel train in the rain

And the wind bites my cheek through the wing

And it's these late nights and this freeway flying

It always makes me sing



There's a Duster tryin' to change my tune

He's pulling up fast on the right

Rolling restlessly by a twenty-four hour moon



And a Wisconsin hiker with a cue-ball head

He's wishing he was home in a Wiscosin bed

But there's fifteen feet of snow in the East

Colder then a welldigger's ass

And it's colder than a welldigger's ass



Oceanside it ends the ride with San Clemente coming up

Those Sunday desperadoes slip by and cruise with a dry back

And the orange drive-in the neon billin'

And the theatre's fillin' to the brim

With slave girls and a hot spurn bucket full of sin



Metropolitan area with interchange and connections

Fly-by-nights from Riverside

And out of state plates running a little late



But the sailors jockey for the fast lane

So 101 don't miss it

There's rolling hills and concrete fields

And the broken line's on your mind

The eights go east and the fives go north

And the merging nexus back and forth

You see your sign, cross the line, signalling with a blink



And the radio's gone off the air

Gives you time to think

And you hear the rumble

As you fumble for a cigarette

And blazing through this midnight jungle

Remember someone that you met

And one more block; the engine talks

Whispers 'home at last'

It whispers 'home at last'

Whispers 'home at last'

It whispers 'home at last'

Whispers 'home at last'



And there are diamonds on my windshield

And these tears from heaven

Well I'm pulling into town on the Interstate

I got me a steel train in the rain

And the wind bites my cheek through the wing

Late nights and freeway flying

Always makes me sing

It always makes me sing



(Hey look here Jack, ok)
