Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Big Time In The Jungle"







Down in Eutaw, Alabama in 1965

A young man 'bout 21, no different than you or I

He's catchin' catfish, and gettin' drunk

But Uncle Sam called, he called him up

Sent him out to Vietnam

That young man

Got his life turned upside down

Turned his smile into a frown

Robbed that king of his crown

For an ideal he didn't even know about



He was gamblin' at the wagon when that army man showed up

And he flashed that pen and paper

And ol' Flukie he signed up

There's gonna be a big time in the jungle

Gonna be a firefight

Gonna be a rumble

Send me out to Vietnam

I'll fight ten men

I got nothin' left in the States for me

I wanna see the world you see

I know that Uncle Sam needs me

To fight for an ideal I know nothing about



Oh the drop point was dusty and the drill sergeant was loud

And he could not see the corpses for the ragin' dust cloud

Grab your duffle bags, head to the checkpoint

Welcome to Vietnam, boys, you're in for a hell of a fight

Take it from the ones who know

The army moves slow

Hurry up and wait, don't sleep late

And learn to hate your brother

Before you hate your foe



On patrol out in the rice fields, them choppers flew low

Glancing for the hand signal to tell you where to go

Then the bombs started fallin'

And they pounded his brain

And he thought about Eutaw and who was to blame

For sendin' him to Vietnam
