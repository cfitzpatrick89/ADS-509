Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Highway Halo"







Driving rain,

Narrow shoulder,

Break down lane,

Marching forward,

Gone where I do not know,

One eye on the open road,

Stepping out in the great unknown,

With a highway halo.



Shaky faith,

Lilly Kimball

Patron saint,

Traveling minstrel,

Let her dusty wings unfold,

Forgive her bad luck soul,

Put her in a purple robe,

And a highway halo.



Passing train,

Sound like silver,

Broken chain,

Shine like gold,

Fortunes just a painted stone,

Gone where those hobos roam,

Crown king of a jungle thrown,

With a highway halo.



Gone where it suits my soul,

Can't you hear my big wheels roll,

You can light up the darkest road,

With a beam of eternal glow,

With a highway

With a highway

With a highway halo
