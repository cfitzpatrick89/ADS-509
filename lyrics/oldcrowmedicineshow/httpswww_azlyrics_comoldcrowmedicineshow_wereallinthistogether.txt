Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"We're All In This Together"







Well my friend, well I see your face so clearly 

Little bit tired, little bit worn through the years 

You sound nervous, you seem lonely

I hardly recognize your voice on the telephone



In between I remember

Just before we wound up broken down

Drive out to the edge of the highway

Follow that lonesome dead-end roadside sound




[Chorus:]

We're all in this thing together

Walkin' the line between faith and fear

This life don't last forever

When you cry I taste the salt in your tears



Well my friend, let's put this thing together

And walk the path that worn out feet have trod

If you wanted we can go home forever

Give up your jaded ways, spell your name to God




[Chorus]



All we are is a picture in a mirror

Fancy shoes to grace our feet

All that there is is a slow road to freedom

Heaven above and the devil beneath




[Chorus]
