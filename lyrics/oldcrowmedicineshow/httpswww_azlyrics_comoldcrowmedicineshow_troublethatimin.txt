Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Trouble That I'm In"







I went down to Nashville 

Rode that L&N 

I'd seen that pretty gal standin' there 

Dropped/brought my tongue down to my chin 

Cause she's so fine 

I was right on time 



She took me down to 2nd street 

She said "I'll be right back" 

I waited there for seven weeks 

Then got back on the track 

And now we're through 

And I'm so blue 




[Chorus:]

Oh no, the trouble that I'm in 

Good times are over I got whiskers on my chin 

And there's a long lonely road, boys 

I'll be travellin' 

So long, tell my troubles to the wind 



Way down south in Louisville 

They showed me to the door 

They hadn't seen a railroad bum 

Since 1924 

Its a rich folk's town 

They don't need me 'round 



The police came and got me 

They took/dropped me way downtown 

Guilty for this vagrancy 

And now I'm prison bound 

Up on the hill 

In Louisville 




[Chorus]
 

Oh no, the trouble... 



If you're ever in Birmingham 

You know where I'll be found 

Standin' in line at the CCC 

Signin' my name down 

On the dotted line 

Puttin' in my dime 



So put away your whiskey boys 

Throw down your gamblin' cards 

Quit sellin' that corn liquor boys 

And sleepin' in freight yards 

In every town 

They'll run you down 




[Chorus]

Oh no the trouble that I'm in...
