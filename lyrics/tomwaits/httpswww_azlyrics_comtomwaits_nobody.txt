Tom Waits Lyrics










"Nobody"







Nobody, nobody

Will ever love you the way I could love you

Cause nobody, nobody is that strong



Love is bittersweet

And life's treasures deep

And no one can keep a love that's gone wrong



Nobody, nobody

Will love you the way that I could

Cause nobody, nobody's that strong

Cause nobody is that strong



Nobody, nobody

Will ever love you the way I can love you

Cause nobody, nobody's that strong



You've had many lovers

You'll have many others

But they'll only just break your poor heart in two



Nobody, nobody

Will love you the way that I could

Cause nobody, nobody's that strong

Cause nobody is that strong
