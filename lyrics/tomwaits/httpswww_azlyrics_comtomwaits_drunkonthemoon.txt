Tom Waits Lyrics










"Drunk On The Moon"







Tight-slacked clad girls on the graveyard shift

'Neath the cement stroll

Catch the midnight drift

Cigar chewing charlie

In that newspaper nest

grifting hot horse tips

On who's running the best




[CHORUS]

And I'm blinded by the neon

Don't try and change my tune

'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone

I'm drunk on the moon



And the moon's a silver slipper

It's pouring champagne stars

Broadway's like a serpent

Pulling shiny top-down cars

Laramer is teeming

With that undulating beat

And some Bonneville is screaming

It's way wilder down the street




[CHORUS]



Hearts flutter and race

The moon's on the wane

Tarts mutter their dream hopes

The night will ordain

Come schemers and dancers

Cherry delight

As a Cleveland-bound Greyhound

And it cuts throught the night



And I've hawked all my yesterdays

Don't try and change my tune

'Cause I thought I heard a saxophone

I'm drunk on the moon
