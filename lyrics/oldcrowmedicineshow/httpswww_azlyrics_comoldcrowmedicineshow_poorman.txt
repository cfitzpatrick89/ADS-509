Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Poor Man"







Hush up, honey, don't you cry

Things are gonna get better in the by-and-by

And there ain't a thing for a poor man

In this world



Work through the winter, work through the spring

Yeah plant my corn and taters and then it wouldn't rain

And there ain't a thing for a poor man

In this world



Now I got down on my knees

Lord I thought I'd pray

Along come a great big flood

Washed everything away

And there ain't a thing for a poor man

In this world



Work through the winter, Lord, work through this fall

All I got for Christmas was a pair of overalls

And there ain't a thing for a poor man

In this world



Well I got down on my knees

Looked up to the sky

All I can think of is to ask the good Lord why

And there ain't a thing for a poor man

In this world



Well hush up, honey, Lord don't get down

You know that I love you every way around

And there ain't a thing for a poor man

In this world



And there ain't a thing for a poor man

In this world
