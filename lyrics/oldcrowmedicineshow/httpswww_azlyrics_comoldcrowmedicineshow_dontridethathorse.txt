Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Don't Ride That Horse"







To Winnipeg, Saskatoon

Eutaw, Wawa, empty room

Hidin' bags, rollin' smokes

Skippin' punchlines, crackin' jokes



So pour it on, toss it back

Play that cocaine, play that shack

Sleepin' every now and then

Curled up tight with Crit and Ben on the ground



I ain't never goin' home again

I was tuggin' at my mama's breast

The first year really is the best



His blood pressure's droppin' down

We ditched the pot and we marked the ground

Ante up and watch him ride

Check that dude, he almost died



Seein' bears, ascendin' clown

Shut our whole damn circus down

Crappin' up in Joliet

We haven't wrecked the trailer yet

But we will

We're gonna get killed



Don't ride that horse

Don't ride that horse, honey

Don't ride that horse back home

Just let him roam

Let him roam
