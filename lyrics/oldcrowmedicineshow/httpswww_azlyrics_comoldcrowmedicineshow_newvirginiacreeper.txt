Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"New Virginia Creeper"







Chug-along, chug-along, like the old Virginia Creeper,

Down among the Mountain Laurel, I'm a gonna meetcha,

Baby stoke my fire, 

So we can make it home tonight!



A come along, come along, come a right to tha station,

Slide me up yo ticket baby, climb up on my engine,

I'll ride you in my sleeper on the New Virginia Creeper Tonight!



I'm a rollin' down the mountain can't you hear my wheels a chuggin',

All the women stand around a pushin and a shovin'

But you can have my lovin', 

Come on and watch my big wheels ride!



I got smoke from my chimney belchin' blacker than coal,

What would you think about me if I bared my soul,

I'll ride you in my sleeper on the New Virginia Creeper Tonight!



And-if-you're,

Quite in a hurry,

Now don'tcha worry,

We won't-ride-slow,

You've got my,

Full-on attention,

Upon my engine,

We'll let, the whistle blow!



Chug-along, chug-along, chuggin' right to your door,

And if you'd like to ride I'd like to ride you some more,

I'll ride you in my sleeper on the New Virginia Creeper Tonight!



And-if-you,

Take up the notion,

For locomotion,

I'll make-a-stop,

And slide right,

Into your station,

But pay attention,

That rail gets hot!



Chug-along, chug-along, chuggin' right to your door,

And if you'd like to ride I'd like to ride you some more,

I'll ride you in my sleeper on the New Virginia Creeper Tonight!



All Right!



I'll ride you in my sleeper on the New Virginia Creeper Tonight!



That's What I Said!



I'll ride you in my sleeper on the New Virginia Creeper Tonight!



One More Time!



I'll ride you in my sleeper on the New Virginia Creeper Tonight!
