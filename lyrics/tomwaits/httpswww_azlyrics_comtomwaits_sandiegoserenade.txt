Tom Waits Lyrics










"San Diego Serenade"







I never saw the morning 'til I stayed up all night

I never saw the sunshine 'til you turned out the light

I never saw my hometown until I stayed away too long

I never heard the melody, until I needed a song.



I never saw the white line, 'til I was leaving you behind

I never knew I needed you 'til I was caught up in a bind

I never spoke 'I love you' 'til I cursed you in vain,

I never felt my heartstrings until I nearly went insane.



I never saw the east coast 'til I move to the west

I never saw the moonlight until it shone off your breast

I never saw your heart 'til someone tried to steal, tried to steal it away

I never saw your tears until they rolled down your face.
