Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Trials & Troubles"







Down the track this morning she did stroll 

In an accident her foot got caught in a hole 

I'm going to tell you the truth 

Die for a touch of that cold hand 

I'd be crying every time the Southern makes it's run 



I'm going to buy them all 

Cigarettes and chewing tobacco when I can 

Trials and troubles are heavy for me 



She's a ramblin' gal 

Bound to leave her home 

I begged my brown skin 

Please don't leave me alone 

I'm going to make amends 

Bound to cry to touch her hand 

I'm going to ride that line 

'Till I see that black train come 



I'm going to buy them all 

Cigarettes and chewing tobacco when I can 

Trials and troubles are heavy for me 



Now people that Southern Pacific make her run 

From Chapel Hill to the state of Washington 

Round the bend at 40 miles

20 tons of loaded frieght a-comin' on 

Florscheim's stuck and it won't come out 

My good gal's dead and gone 



I'm going to buy them all 

Cigarettes and chewing tobacco when I can 

Trials and troubles are heavy for me 



Trials and troubles are heavy for me
