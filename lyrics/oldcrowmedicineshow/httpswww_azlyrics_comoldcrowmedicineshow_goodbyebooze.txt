Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Goodbye Booze"







Well she tore my clothes

She swelled my head 

So goodbye booze I'm goin to bed 

I had a good time, but we couldn't agree 

So you see what booze has done for me 



Oh goodbye booze 

Forever more 

My boozin' days will soon be o'er 

I had a good time, but we couldn't agree 

So you see what booze has done for me 



Well she slammed my head 

She broke my heart 

So goodbye booze its time we part 

I had a good time 

But we couldn't agree 

So you see what booze has done for me 



So goodbye booze 

Forever more 

My boozin' days will soon be o'er 

I had a good time 

But we couldn't agree 

So you see what booze has done for me 



Well she whipsered low, how sweet it sounds 

Won't don't you take another ride on the merry go round 

Oh I had a good time, but we couldn't agree 

So you see what booze has done for me 



So goodbye booze 

Forever more 

My boozin' days will soon be o'er 

I had a good time, but we couldn't agree 

So you see what booze has done for me
