Tom Waits Lyrics










"Lonely"







Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely eyes, lonely face, lonely lonely in your place.

Lonely, lonely, lonely eyes, lonely face, lonely lonely in your place.



I thought that I knew all that there was to, lonely, lonely, lonely...



Melanie Jane, won't feel the pain.

Lonely, lonely, lonely eyes, lonely eyes, lonely lonely in your place.



And I thought that I knew all that there was to

Lonely, lonely, lonely eyes, lonely eyes, lonely lonely in your place, and

I still love you, I still love you, lonely, lonely...
