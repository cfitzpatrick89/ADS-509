Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Methamphetamine"







Times, they ain't like nothing they used to be

From rocky mount' to northeast tennessee

Where the river flows with a dusty, cold disease

And the babies whine cause they can't find nothing to eat



But, mama, she ain't hungry no more

She's waiting for a knock on the trailer door



It's gonna rock you like a hurricane

It's gonna rock you 'til you lose sleep

It's gonna rock you 'til you're out of a job

It's gonna rock you 'til you're out on the street

It's gonna rock you 'til you're down on your knees

It's gonna have you begging pretty please

It's gonna rock you like a hurricane

Methamphetamine



Don't need no phd for a hundred dollar card

Just find a crooked cop and that doctor disregard

Cause when it's either the mine or the kentucky national guard

Um, I'd rather sell him a line than to be dying in the coal yard



Now, papa, he ain't hungry no more

He's waiting for a knock on the trailer door



It's gonna rock you like a hurricane

It's gonna rock you 'til you lose sleep

It's gonna rock you 'til you're out of a job

It's gonna rock you 'til you're out on the street

It's gonna rock you 'til you're down on your knees

It's gonna have you begging pretty please

It's gonna rock you like a hurricane

Methamphetamine



Well, it's a war out there, and it's fought by poor white men

From the plateau to the falls of the cumberland

You better watch your back, 'cause you just can't trust a friend

And the method man is going to get you in the end



So listen to the whispering wind

It sounds like a big storm rolling in



It's gonna rock you like a hurricane

It's gonna rock you 'til you lose sleep

It's gonna rock you 'til you're out of a job

It's gonna rock you 'til you're out on the street

It's gonna rock you 'til you're down on your knees

It's gonna have you begging pretty please

It's gonna rock you like a hurricane

Methamphetamine
