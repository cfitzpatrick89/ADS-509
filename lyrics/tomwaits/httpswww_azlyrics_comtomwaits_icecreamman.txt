Tom Waits Lyrics










"Ice Cream Man"







I'll be clickin' by your house about two forty-five

Sidewalk sundae strawberry surprise,

I got a cherry popsicle right on time

A big stick, mamma, that'll blow your mind



'Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a one-man band (yeah)

I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.



Baby, missed me in the alley, baby, don't you fret

Come back around and don't forget,

When you're tired and you're hungry and you want something cool,

Got something better than a swimming pool



'Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a one-man band

I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.

'Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a one-man band

I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.



See me coming, you ain't got no change

Don't worry baby, it can be arranged:

Show me you can smile, baby just for me

Fix you with a drumstick, I'll do it for free



'Cause I'm the ice cream man, I'm a one-man band

I'm the ice cream man, honey, I'll be good to you.

Be good to you, be good to you,

Good to you yeah, good to you yeah, good to you yeah, good to you yeah,

Good to you yeah, good to you, I'll be good to you, I'll be good to you...
