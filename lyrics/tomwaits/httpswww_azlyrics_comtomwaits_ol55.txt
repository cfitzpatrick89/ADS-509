Tom Waits Lyrics










"Ol' 55"







Well my time went so quickly, I went lickety-splickly out to my old '55

As I drove away slowly, feeling so holy, God knows, I was feeling alive.



Now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck, freeway cars and trucks,

Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade

Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer,

Oh, Lord, let me tell you that the feeling's getting stronger.



And it's six in the morning, gave me no warning; I had to be on my way.

Well there's trucks all a-passing me, and the lights are all flashing,

I'm on my way home from your place.



And now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck, freeway cars and trucks,

Stars beginning to fade, and I lead the parade

Just a-wishing I'd stayed a little longer,

Oh, Lord, let me tell you that the feeling's getting stronger.



And my time went so quickly, I went lickety-splickly out to my old '55

As I pulled away slowly, feeling so holy, God knows, I was feeling alive.



Now the sun's coming up, I'm riding with Lady Luck,

Freeway cars and trucks, freeway cars and trucks, freeway cars and trucks...
