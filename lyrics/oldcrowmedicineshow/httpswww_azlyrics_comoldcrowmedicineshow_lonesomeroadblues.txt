Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Lonesome Road Blues"







I walk down that lonesome line 

Hung down my head I cry 

I wept I cried under the willow tree 

About the deep blue sea 



My mama my dead papa 

Can be found 

And my brother 

On the county road 



Now I've been down that long plank walk 

I'm on my way back home 

You cause me to weep you did cause me to mourn 

You cause me to leave my home 



Your fast mail train coming round the track 

Come kill my little blue-eyed girl 

They took her down that smoky track 

Brought her back on that cooling board 



I'm looking down that long tunnel light 

Just as far as I care to see 

I have no money lost my blue-eyed girl 

These blues won't set me free 



You did cause me to weep you did cause me to mourn 

You cause me to leave my home 

I cried last night and the night before 

I swore not to cry anymore
