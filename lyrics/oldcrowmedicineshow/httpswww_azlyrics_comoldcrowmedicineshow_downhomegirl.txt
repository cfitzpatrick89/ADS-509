Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Down Home Girl"







Well I swear your perfume, baby, is made out of turnip greens

Every time I kiss you girl, it tastes like pork and beans



Even though you're wearing those uptown high heels

I can tell from your giant step you've been walking through the cotton fields



Ohhhhhh you're so down home girl



Every time you monkey, child, it takes my breath away

Well, every time you move like that, girl, I got to get down and pray

Girl, you know that dress you're wearin' made out of fiber glass

Every time you move like that, girl, I got to go to Sunday mass



Ohhhhhh you're so down home girl



I'm going to take you to the muddy river and push you in

So I can watch the water roll on down your velvet skin

I'm gonna take you down to New Orleans, down in Dixie land

So I can watch you do the second line with an umbrella in your hand



Ohhhhhh you're so down home girl
