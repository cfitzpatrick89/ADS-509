Tom Waits Lyrics










"I Wish I Was In New Orleans (In The Ninth Ward)"







Well, I wish I was in New Orleans, I can see it in my dreams,

Arm-in-arm down Burgundy, a bottle and my friends and me



Hoist up a few tall cool ones, play some pool and listen

To that tenor saxophone calling me home

And I can hear the band begin "When the Saints Go Marching In",

And by the whiskers on my chin, New Orleans, I'll be there



I'll drink you under the table, be red-nosed, go for walks,

The old haunts what I wants is red beans and rice

And wear the dress I like so well, and meet me at the old saloon,

Make sure that there's a Dixie moon, New Orleans, I'll be there



And deal the cards roll the dice, if it ain't that old Chuck E. Weiss,

And Claiborne Avenue, me and you Sam Jones and all



And I wish I was in New Orleans, 'cause I can see it in my dreams,

Arm-in-arm down Burgundy, a bottle and my friends and me

New Orleans, I'll be there
