Tom Waits Lyrics










"Shiver Me Timbers"







I'm leavin' my fam'ly

Leavin' all my friends

My body's at home

But my heart's in the wind

Where the clouds are like headlines

On a new front page sky

My tears are salt water

And the moon's full and high



And I know Martin Eden's

Gonna be proud of me

And many before me

Who've been called by the sea

To be up in the crow's nest

Singin' my say

Shiver me Timbers

'Cause I'm a-sailin' away



And the fog's liftin'

And the sand's shiftin'

I'm driftin' on out

Ol' Captain Ahab

He ain't got nothin' on me, now.

So swallow me, don't follow me

I'm trav'lin' alone

Blue water's my daughter

'n I'm gonna skip like a stone



So please call my missus

Gotta tell her not to cry

'Cause my goodbye is written

By the moon in the sky

Hey and nobody knows me

I can't fathom my stayin'

Shiver me timbers

'Cause I'm a-sailin' away



And the fog's liftin'

And the sand's shiftin'

I'm driftin' on out

Ol' Captain Ahab

He ain't got nothin' on me

So come and swallow me, follow me

I'm trav'lin' alone

Blue water's my daughter

'n I'm gonna skip like a stone



And I'm leavin' my family

Leavin' all my friends

My body's at home

But my heart's in the wind

Where the clouds are like headlines

Upon a new front page sky

And shiver me timbers

'Cause I'm a-sailin' away
