Tom Waits Lyrics










"Midnight Lullaby"







Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of rye

Hush-a bye my baby, no need to be crying.

You can burn the midnight oil with me as long as you will

Stare out at the moon upon the windowsill, and dream...



Sing a song of sixpence, pocket full of rye

Hush-a bye my baby, no need to be crying.

There's dew drops on the window sill, gumdrops in your head

Slipping into dream land, you're nodding your head, so dream...



Dream of West Virginia, or of the British Isles

'Cause when you are dreaming, you see for miles and miles.

When you are much older, remember when we sat

At midnight on the windowsill, and had this little chat

And dream, come on and dream, come on and dream, and dream, and dream...
