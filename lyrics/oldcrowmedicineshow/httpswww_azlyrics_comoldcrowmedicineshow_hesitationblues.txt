Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Hesitation Blues"







I was born in England, raised in France 

They'd send the coathanger, wouldn't send the pants 




[Chorus:]

Tell me how long must I wait 

Or can I get you now or must I hesitate? 



I was raised in Alabama, born in Tennessee 

Don't you like my peaces don't you shake-a my tree 




[Chorus]
 



If the river was whiskey and I was a duck 

I'd dive to the bottom boys I'd never come up 




[Chorus]
 



Well looked down the road far as I can see 

Got no woman boys the blues got me 




[Chorus]



If the river was whiskey and the branches were wine 

You could see me at the -- any old time 




[Chorus x2]
