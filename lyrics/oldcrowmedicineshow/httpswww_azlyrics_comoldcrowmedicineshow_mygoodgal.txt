Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"My Good Gal"







Well she drug me down

Tossed me 'round

Slammed my name all over town

My good gal ain't no good to me

She makes true love more like misery



Now I'm walkin' hunched

I get drunk a bunch

So would you sucker up and take a punch

My good gal ain't no good to me

And I think I've acted reasonably



Ah, but I miss her

And all that I wish from her



Is the time of day

Don't go out of your way

Just a-leave me with a stack of them bills to pay

My good gal ain't no good to me

And she don't have the courtesy



To shut the door

When she's been playin a whore

I don't wanna see his rags out on the floor

My good gal ain't no good to me

And I only wish that she could see



That I miss her



Ah, but I miss her

All I have is a picture... of her



It was taken years ago

I was a kid, you know

Just a-leanin' up against that El Dorado

My good gal ain't no good to me

And the final word belongs to me



Because I drove her out of town

And I shot her down

And I left her there in the cold, cold ground

My good gal ain't no good to me

Not even in her memory
