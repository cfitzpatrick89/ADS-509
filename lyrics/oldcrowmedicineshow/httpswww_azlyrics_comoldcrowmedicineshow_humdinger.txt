Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Humdinger"







Party of the century

No cops allowed

Just me and seven hundred others

Come on, join the crowd



We got wine, whiskey, women and guns

How can you afford to not be having any fun

If you got a gal, bring 'er

And we'll all have a humdinger



Naked horseshoes without care

Body surfing on a river of beer

All the neighbors are saying their prayers

We'll lift our glasses high in the air



We got wine, whiskey, women and guns

How can you afford to not be having any fun

If you're not a right-winger

Then we'll all have a humdinger



Making mardi gras look like work

The belly dancers have gone berserk

The morning's here, we're all still awake

Just looking for some more drugs to take

Happened on a mound of fire ants

Only lost a shoe and a pair of pants

Went down hard, got up like a champ

To see a biker dancing on my amp



If you're not a folk singer

Then we'll all have a humdinger

If you're not a folk singer

Then we'll all have a humdinger
