Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Next Go 'Round"







When the summer is come and gone

As the leaves fall on the lawn

I think about pleasures pass me bye

And I am thinking of my old home

And the love I left behind

No I couldn't I go back there if I try



On my next go round

I'm gonna keep it to

The dreams we new

Before I broke them down

Gonna take your hand

Wanna be the man

Who pulls you from the ground

I won't let you down

On my next go round



We were standing on the edges

Of a thousand burning bridges

Sifting through the ashes every day

What we thought would never end

Now is nothing more than a memory

The way things were before

I lost my way



On my next go round

I'm gonna keep it to

The dreams we new

Before I broke them down

Gonna take your hand

Wanna be the man

Who pulls you from the ground

I won't let you down

On my next go round



Now the winds are blowing steady

My bags are awful heavy

I wish that I could stop and turn around

But there are no second chances

In a world of circumstances

Oh in this life you don't get no next round



On my next go round

Gonna start again

Gonna let you in

Gonna lay our burdens down

Gonna be the one to never turn and run

I'll always be around

I won't let you down

On the next go round



I won't let you down

On the next go round
