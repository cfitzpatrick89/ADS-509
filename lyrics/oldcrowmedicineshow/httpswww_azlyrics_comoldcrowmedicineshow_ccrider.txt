Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"CC Rider"







CC Rider, see what you gone done 

CC Rider, see what you gone done 

CC Rider, see what you gone done 

Well hey, hey, hey, hey



Well, you made me love you, now your man done come

Made me love you, now your man done come

Made me love you, now your man done come

Hey, hey, hey, hey



You were standin' in the kitchen in that morning gown

Standin' in the kitchen in that morning gown

Standin' in the kitchen in that morning gown

Hey, hey, hey, hey



I was lookin' right at her when that sun went down

Lookin' right at her when that sun went down

Lookin' right at her when that sun went down

Hey, hey, hey, hey



Well, CC Rider, see what you gone done 

CC Rider, now see what you gone done 

CC Rider, you'll see what you gone done 

Hey, hey, hey, hey
