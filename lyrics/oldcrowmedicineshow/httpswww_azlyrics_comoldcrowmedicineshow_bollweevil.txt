Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Boll Weevil"







Now the boll weevil said to the farmer, now what do ya think of that 

Come on down to my house make a home in my old straw hat 



Lookin for a home 

Yeah lookin for a home 

Lookin for a home 

Lookin for a home 



Farmer gone to the merchant, I need a lil meat and meal 

Just go on away from me ya got a boll weevil down your ?peel? 



Lookin for a home 

Yeah lookin for a home 

Lookin for a home 

Ah, lookin for a home 



First time that I seen him a fiddlin in the square 

Next time I seen him got his whole darn family there 



Lookin for a home 

Yeah lookin for a home 

Lookin for a home 

Ah, lookin for a home 



Farmer gone to the banker, I need to cash a check 

Just go on away from me ya got a boll weevil down your neck 



Lookin for a home 

Yeah lookin for a home 

Lookin for a home 

Yeah, lookin for a home
