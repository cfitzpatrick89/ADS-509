Tom Waits Lyrics










"Rosie"







Well I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn

Nobody's up except the moon and me,

And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree

All that you left me was a melody.

Rosie, why do you evade? Rosie, how can I persuade? Rosie...



And the moon's all up, full and big, apricot tips in an indigo sky,

And I've been loving you, Rosie, since the day I was born

And I'll love you, Rosie 'til the day I die.

Rosie, why do you evade? Rosie, how can I persuade? Rosie...



Rosie, why do you evade? Rosie, how can I persuade? Rosie...



And I'm sitting on a windowsill, blowing my horn

Nobody's up except the moon and me,

And a lazy old tomcat on a midnight spree

All that you left me was a melody.

Rosie, why do you evade? Rosie, how can I persuade? Rosie...
