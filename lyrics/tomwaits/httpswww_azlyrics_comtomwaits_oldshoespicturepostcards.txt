Tom Waits Lyrics










"Old Shoes (& Picture Postcards)"







I'm singing this song, it's time it was sung

I've been putting it off for a while,

But it's harder by now, 'cause the truth is so clear

That I cry when I'm seeing you smile.

So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear

And your tears cannot bind me anymore,

And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes

Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.



Every time that I tried to tell that we'd lost the magic we had at the start,

I would weep my heart when I looked in your eyes

And I searched once again for the spark.

So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear

And your tears cannot bind me anymore,

And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes

Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.



I can see by your eyes, it's time now to go

So I'll leave you to cry in the rain,

Though I held in my hand, the key to all joy

Honey my heart was not born to be tamed.

So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear

And your tears cannot bind me anymore,

And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes

Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.



So goodbye, so long, the road calls me dear

And your tears cannot bind me anymore,

And farewell to the girl with the sun in her eyes

Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.

Can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone, can I kiss you, and then I'll be gone.
