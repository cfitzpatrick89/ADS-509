Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Cocaine Habit"







Well the cocaine habit is mighty bad

It's the worst old habit that I ever had 

Hey hey honey take a whiff on me 



Take a whiff on me

Take a whiff on me

All you rounders take a wiff on me 

Hey hey honey take a wiff on me 



I went to Mr. Lehman's on a lope 

He's got a sign on the window, "no more dope" 

Hey hey honey take a whiff on me 



Take a whiff on me 

Take a whiff on me 

All you rounders take a wiff on me 

Hey hey honey take a wiff on me 



Well I love my whiskey and I love my gin 

But the way I love my coke is a dog gone sin 

Hey hey honey take a whiff on me 



Take a whiff on me 

Take a whiff on me 

All you rounders take a wiff on me 

Hey hey honey take a wiff on me 



Well since cocaine went outta style 

You can catch 'em shootin needles all the while 

Hey hey honey take a whiff on me 



Take a whiff on me 

Take a whiff on me 

All you rounders take a wiff on me 

hey hey honey take a wiff on me 



Take a whiff on me 

Take a whiff on me 

All you rounders take a wiff on me 

Hey hey honey take a wiff on me 



Take a whiff on me 

Take a whiff on me 

All you rounders take a wiff on me 

Hey hey honey take a wiff on me
