Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Wagon Wheel"







Headed down south to the land of the pines

I'm thumbin' my way to North Caroline

Starin' up the road

And pray to God I see headlights

I made it down the coast in seventeen hours

Pickin' me a bouquet of dogwood flowers

And I'm a-hopin' for Raleigh

I can see my baby tonight



So rock me mama like a wagon wheel

Rock me mama any way you feel

Hey mama rock me

Rock me mama like the wind and the rain

Rock me mama like a south-bound train

Hey mama rock me



Runnin' from the cold up in New England

I was born to be a fiddler in an old-time string band

My baby plays the guitar

I pick a banjo now

Oh, the North country winters keep a-gettin' me

And I lost my money playin' poker so I had to up and leave

But I ain't a-turnin' back

To livin' that old life no more



So rock me mama like a wagon wheel

Rock me mama any way you feel

Hey mama rock me

Rock me mama like the wind and the rain

Rock me mama like a south-bound train

Hey mama rock me



Walkin' due south out of Roanoke

I caught a trucker out of Philly

Had a nice long toke

But he's a-headed west from the Cumberland Gap

To Johnson City, Tennessee

And I gotta get a move on before the sun

I hear my baby callin' my name

And I know that she's the only one

And if I die in Raleigh

At least I will die free



So rock me mama like a wagon wheel

Rock me mama any way you feel

Hey mama rock me

Rock me mama like the wind and the rain

Rock me mama like a south-bound train

Hey mama rock me
