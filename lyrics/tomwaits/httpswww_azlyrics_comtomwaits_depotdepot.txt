Tom Waits Lyrics










"Depot, Depot"







Depot, depot, what am I doing here?

Depot, depot, what am I doing here?

I ain't coming, I ain't going

My confusion is showing

Outside the midnight wind is blowing Sixth Avenue

I'm gonna paint myself blue

At the depot



I watch the taxis pull up and idle

I can't claim title to a single memory

He offered me a key

'Cause opportunity don't knock

He has no tongue and she cannot talk

You're gonna shuffle when you walk

At the depot



This peeping-Tom needs a peephole

And an uptempo song

To move me along

When I find this depot baby

I'm on a roll just like a pool ball baby

I'm gonna be there at the roll call maybe

At the depot



Outside the midnight wind is blowing Sixth Avenue

Oh, tell me what a poor boy to do

At the depot

I'm on a roll just like a pool ball baby

I'm gonna be there at the roll call maybe

At the depot

The depot
