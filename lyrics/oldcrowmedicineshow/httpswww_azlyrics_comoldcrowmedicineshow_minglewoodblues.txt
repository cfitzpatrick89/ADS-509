Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Minglewood Blues"







Well, don't you never let no woman rule your mind

Don't you never let no woman rule your mind

Well, she'll leave you troubled, worried all the time



Well, I got a letter, mama, you ought'a heard what it read

Lord, I got a letter, mama, you ought'a heard what it read

If you're coming back, baby, now's your only chance



Don't you never let no woman rule your mind

Well, don't you never let no woman rule your mind

Well, she'll leave you troubled, worried all the time



So, don't you wish that your fairer was little and cute like mine

Oh, don't you wish that your fairer was little and cute like mine

Well, she's a married woman, Lord, she come and see me sometimes



Well, don't you never let no woman rule your mind

Don't you never let no woman rule your mind

Well, she'll leave you troubled, now, worried all the time



Well, don't you never let no woman rule your mind

Don't you never let no woman rule your mind

Well, she'll leave you troubled, worried all the time

Lord, she'll leave you troubled, worried all the time
