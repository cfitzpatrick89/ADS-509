Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Union Maid"







Now, there once was a union maid

She never was afraid

Of the goons and the ginks

And the company finks

And the deputy sheriffs who made the raid

And she went to the union hall

Where a meeting, it was called

And when the boys would come up to her

Lord, this is what she'd say



Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union

I'm stickin' to the union, I'm stickin' to the union

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union

I'm stickin' to the union, till the day I die



Now this union maid was wise

To the tricks of the company spies

She'd take the dare

She didn't care

She'd always organize the guys

And she always got her way

When she asked for better pay

She showed her card to the National Guard 

Honey, this is what they'd say



Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union

I'm stickin' to the union, I'm stickin' to the union

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union

I'm stickin' to the union, till the day I die



Now, you girls who wanna be free

Just take a little tip from me

Oh, get you a man who's a union man

And you can join the Ladies' Auxiliary 

Because married life ain't hard

When you got a union card

And the union life is a happy life

If you've got a union wife



Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union

I'm stickin' to the union, I'm stickin' to the union

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union

I'm stickin' to the union, till the day I die



Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union

I'm stickin' to the union, I'm stickin' to the union

Oh, you can't scare me, I'm stickin' to the union

I'm stickin' to the union, till the day I die
