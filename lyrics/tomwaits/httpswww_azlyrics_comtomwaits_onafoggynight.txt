Tom Waits Lyrics










"On A Foggy Night"







It was all upon a foggy night, an abandoned road

In a twilight mirror mirage

With no indication of any kind of service station

Or an all-night garage

I was misinformed, I was misdirected

Cause the interchange never intersected

Leaving me marooned beneath a bloodshot moon

All upon a foggy night, a foggy night

All upon a foggy night



It was kind of an abandoned road, in a blurred brocade collage

Is that a road motel, I can't really tell

You gotta tell me, is that a vacancy lodge

There's no consolation, what kind of situation

To be aimlessly askew amidst a powder blue

No tell-tale light clue



Spun just like the spell you spin

This precarious pandemonium

Roslyn, I'm stranded, all upon a foggy night



Like a sweepstakes ticket for a Broadway arcade

Heads you win, tails I lose

I'm rambling, I'm gambling

All upon a foggy night

Foggy night

Foggy night

Foggy night



You got the vice grips on my personality

It's all upon a foggy night

All upon a foggy night

All upon a foggy night

On a foggy night

All upon a foggy

All upon a foggy night
