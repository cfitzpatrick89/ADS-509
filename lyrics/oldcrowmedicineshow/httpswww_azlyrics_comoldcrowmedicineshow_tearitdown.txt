Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Tear It Down"







Every time I'd hit her she'd holler "Police" 

Cook them biscuits, cook 'em brown 

Done talkin' I'll tear it around 

If you catch another mule kickin' in your stall 

Then tear it down 




[Chorus:]

Oh, tear it down (bed, slats and all)

Oh, tear it down (bed, slats and all)

Oh, tear it down (bed, slats and all)

Oh, tear it down (bed, slats and all)

If you catch another mule kickin' in your stall 

Man, you gotta tear it down 



Mr. Evans on the avenue ain't ashamed 

To see that monkey whiffin' that cocaine 

Went upstairs to ring the bell 

Police in the alley sniffin' cocaine 

When you catch another mule kickin' in your stall 

Then tear it down 




[Chorus]



Every time I'd hit her she'd holler "Police" 

Cook them biscuits, cook 'em brown 

Done talkin' I'll tear it around 

If you catch another mule kickin' in your stall 

Then tear it down 




[Chorus]
