Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"That'll Be A Better Day"







The mississippi is deep and wide 

My good gal left me on the other side 



Thats all right cause I dont worry 

Oh that'll be a better day 



If ya dont like a my peaches dont shake a my tree 

Get outa my orchard woman if you please 



Thats all right cause I dont worry 

Oh that'll be a better day 



Ashes to ashes and dust to dust 

Show me a woman that a man can trust 



Thats all right cause I dont worry 

Oh that'll be a better day 



It was in the spring one sunny day 

My good girl left me, oh she went astray 



Thats all right cause I dont worry 

Oh that'll be a better day 




[Additional verse]



She called me in dallas, in el paso 

Said "come home daddy oh I need you so" 



Thats all right cause I dont worry 

Oh that'll be a better day
