Tom Waits Lyrics










"Eggs And Sausage (In A Cadillac With Susan Michelson)"







Nighthawks at the diner of Emma's Forty-Niner

There's a rendezvous of strangers around the coffee urn tonight

All the gypsy hacks and the insomniacs

Now the paper's been read, now the waitress said



'Eggs and sausage and a side of toast

Coffee and a roll, hash browns over easy

Chile in a bowl with burgers and fries

What kind of pie? Yeah...'



It's a graveyard charade, it's a late shift masquerade

And it's two for a quarter, dime for a dance

Woolworth's rhinestone diamond earrings and a sideways glance

Now the register rings, now the waitress sings



Eggs and sausage and a side of toast

Coffee and a roll, hash browns over easy

Chile in a bowl with burgers and fries

What kind of pie? Yeah



Now well, the classified section offers no direction

It's a cold caffeine in a nicotine cloud

Now the touch of your fingers lingers burning in my memory

I've been eighty-sixed from your scheme

Now I'm in a melodramatic nocturnal scene

Now I'm a refugee from a disconcerted affair

Now the lead pipe morning falls, now the waitress calls



'Eggs and sausage, another side of toast

Coffee and a roll, hash browns over easy

Chile in a bowl with burgers and fries

Now what kind of pie?'



Ã la mode if you will

Just come in and join the crowd

Had some time to kill, yeah

You see, I just come in to join the crowd

Had some time to kill

Just come in to join the crowd

Cause I had some time to kill
