Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Alabama High-Test"







Alabama high test....got me in a big mess

Higher than a wild cat....runnin from the wolfpack

They're gona put me in the slammer

If they catch me with that Alabama high test



65 southbound, cruisin with a half pound

Blue lights spinin round, better lay the hammer down

Dirt road Tennessee, Aint nobody stoppin me

Short run, state line, gotta keep makin time

Alabama high test...



Huff paint, cocaine, playin chicken with a train

Smack dab, Meth lab, mellow out, rehab

Percocet, cigarette, I dont need no more of that

Just gimmie some down home Dixie fried homegrown

Alabama high test...



Alabama high test....got me in a big mess

Higher than a wild cat....runnin from the wolfpack

They're gona put me in the slamer

If they catch me with that Alabama high test



Drug bust, disgust, plead with the cucuit judge

"Son dont be coy, send you up the river Boy"

Jump suit, chain gang, shackles on my feet and hand

Standin on I-65 wishin I was rolling by with

Alabama high test



Alabama high test....got me in a big mess

Higher than a wild cat....running from the wolf pack

They're gonna put me in the slammer

If they catch me with that Alabama high test
