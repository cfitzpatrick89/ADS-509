Old Crow Medicine Show Lyrics










"Take 'Em Away"








[Chorus:]

Take 'em away, take 'em away, Lord

Take away these chains from me

My heart is broken 'cause my spirit's not free

Lord take away these chains from me



Some birds' feathers are too bright to be caged

I know I'm not that colorful but a bird just the same

Open up your gate now, let me put down my load

So I can feel at ease and go back to my home




[Chorus]



Sun beatin' down, my legs can't seem to stand

There's a boss man at a turnrow with a rifle in his hand

I've got nine child, nothin' in the pan

My wife she died hungry while I was plowin' land




[Chorus]



Can't see when I go to work, can't see when I get off

How do you expect a man not to get lost

Every year I just keep getting deeper in debt

If there's a happy day, Lord, I haven't seen one yet




[Chorus]



Land that I love is the land that I'm workin'

But it's hard to love it all the time when your back is a-hurtin'

Gettin' too old now to push this here plow

Please let me lay down so I can look at the clouds




[Chorus]



Land that I know is where two rivers collide

The Brazos the Navaso and the big blue sky

Flood plains, freight trains, watermelon vines

Of any place on God's green earth, this is where I choose to die




[Chorus]
